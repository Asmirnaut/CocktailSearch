This project was built with :
- Firestore
- Next.js
- React.js
- Styled with Material-ui

Future features I will be working on : 
- Users will be able to log-in and click the hearts on the individual drink cards and save them to the "My Favorite Drinks" tab
- Users will be able to add their own favorite drink recipes if they are not already available on the page
- Search feature will be able to support searching for ingredients, not just specific drinks
